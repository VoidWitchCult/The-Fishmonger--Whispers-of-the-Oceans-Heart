	"VoidWitchCult.CP.TheFishmongerNPC.Event.CoolGalBernadette8HeartsPart2.Photo1": "I'll go by order, alright?#$b#The first one is one I found when I rummaged around in the attic of our home and found a box with old memorabilia. When I asked Mom about it she said it was all the way back when he often took his motorcycle on long journeys.#$b#He was with a friend at that time and they met some guy in a business suit.#$b#Turns out said guy went away from a company party and by the time he sobered up in the cold air of the night he was in the middle of nowhere.#$b#So naturally they all hang out and took him with them on the motorcycle, haha!#$b#They're still friends to this day.",
	"VoidWitchCult.CP.TheFishmongerNPC.Event.CoolGalBernadette8HeartsPart2.Photo2": "Look.......#$b#...this photo shows him when he took me on my first trip. That lil lad there is me, hehe!#$b#I still remember it vividly...he took me to his favorite spots and we had Poutine in a greasy old gas station. As I sat on his bike and ate I watched the sun rise and just had this deep emotional feeling in my chest.#$b#In that moment I just felt free.#$b#Dad took me on many other trips after that and I loved every one of them.#$b#He showed me parts of the world I'd've never otherwise seen and gave me possibilities of having perspectives not everyone gets to experience.",
	"VoidWitchCult.CP.TheFishmongerNPC.Event.CoolGalBernadette8HeartsPart2.Photo3": "Oh! Here, the third ones just him, haha! I just really liked how clear this one was as he's the focal point.#$b#Heh, he really likes to ride his motorcycle during the night. When I asked him about it he explained to me that there's just something special about the night. Like it simply feels different and the things you do and see during those times are just not the same during the day.#$b#Back then I didn't really understand what he meant by that but as I grew older and went out during the night myself I began to understand.#$b#The silence of the night...the stars and the moon as your companions...it's just something magical about it.",
	"VoidWitchCult.CP.TheFishmongerNPC.Event.CoolGalBernadette8HeartsPart2.Photo4": "Look at this picture, @. It's Dad and his bandmates!#$b#I've met everyone of them so I can say with certaincy that they're great people, hehe!#$b#Mom is there too. They met back when he was out with his friends having a jam session and she joined in.#$b#I was told they had a pretty wild relationship. I guess that's just natural with their livestyle...well, they didn't stay together but remained friends. Mom settled down while Dad remained a free spirit and went around the world.#$b#While their band split he still remained doing solo work whenever he felt like it.",
	"VoidWitchCult.CP.TheFishmongerNPC.Event.CoolGalBernadette8HeartsPart2.Photo5": "The last picture is from one of Dads trips when he was in his band. I picked it because there's a good view of his guitar.#$b#Did I ever tell you that he can play several instruments?#$b#Like many he learned a classical instrument when he was young because of his parents but he ultimately stuck with his guitar.#$b#Not that he hated playing violin, he still does it now and again, but the guitar is his true calling he told me.#$b#I don't know who's that in the picture with him thought. It could be one of his fans.#$b#Mom said she really had to fight off quite a few gals and pals when she was together with him.",
	"VoidWitchCult.CP.TheFishmongerNPC.Event.CoolGalBernadette8HeartsPart2.SumUp": "There are more pictures but I haven't edited them enough after scanning so some are quite, uh, let's say I gotta work on them first before I can use them.#$b#I made a document typing everything down about them though so I can make a whole collection of his memories!#$b#Whenever he gets back I will show him and I want to have some songs ready to play for him as well!",
	"VoidWitchCult.CP.TheFishmongerNPC.Event.CoolGalBernadette8HeartsPart2.PrettyNeat": "Pretty neat, right?#$b#I think I will work a bit more on this and then go on a little trip myself. I want to take a little trip on memory lane, I guess, heh. Don't worry, I won't be gone for long.",
