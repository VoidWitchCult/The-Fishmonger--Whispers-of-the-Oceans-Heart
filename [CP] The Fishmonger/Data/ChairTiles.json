/* ABA: Data/ChairTiles entry keys cannot contain periods in them, so although they need to be globally unique they can't use a mod ID as a prefix (unless the mod ID happens to not use periods, which is not the case with yours or with most mods). I've used VWCF_ as a prefix instead (VoidWitchCult Fishmonger - added the F in case you happen to make another mod in future that somehow uses similarly named tilesheets). */
